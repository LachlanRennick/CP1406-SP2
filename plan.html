<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan - Barrier Reef Orchestra</h1>
<p><strong>Name:Lachlan Rennick, Kye Cook, Mathilde Bellec</strong><br>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The website will be designed with two goals in mind; firstly, it will aim to increase the number of attendees to the Barrier Reef Orchestra performances, and will secondly aim to lower the average age of attendees.
<br>To this end, the website will be intended to be an advertising platform through which awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra can be spread, increasing general interest. 
<br>The new website will also have to be more interactive and engaging. The objective is to make people spend more time on the website.
<br>(Finally, more than letting people know what the Barrier Reef Orchestra is doing and promoting their concerts, the website is aimed at becoming a source of information about classical music.) educational goal
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success will be determined via the checking of attendance numbers. There should be a significant increase in ticket sales.
<br>The second goal's success can be measured by recording the ages of attendees. Therefore, collecting ages while selling tickets will be essential.
<br>Furthermore, to attract younger audiences, the Barrier Reef Orchestra should determine different prices for each group of customers. Thus, they will easily find out the number of student tickets they sold, for example.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The website will be designed for the new audience the Orchestra is trying to reach : Highschool kids, University students and young adults. 
However, it will not have to exclude the original and faithful audience.
<br>In order to entice a younger audience, the website will integrate social media. Furthermore, the whole design will be more interactive and engaging.
