<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan - Barrier Reef Orchestra</h1>
<p><strong>Name:Lachlan Rennick, Kye Cook, Mathilde Bellec</strong><br>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The website will be designed with two goals in mind; firstly, the website will aim to increase the number of attendees to the Barrier Reef Orchestra performances, and will secondly aim to lower the average age of attendees. The first goal will be accomplished through the usage of the website as an advertising platform through which awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra can be spread, increasing general interest. The second goal can be reached via the thorough integration of social media into the website, allowing the tech-savvy younger generations to pass knowledge around easier, which in turn will increase interest among the younger generations that view the website.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the first goal of the website will be determined via the checking of attendance numbers. In order to claim that the website has been a success in meeting the first goal, there should be a 50% increase in attendance numbers within a 6-month time period from the site's launch, which can be measured in ticket sales. The second goal's success can be measured by recording the ages of attendees. In order to claim that the website has been a success in meeting the second goal, the average age of attendees must be reduced by 5 years. In regards to collecting the information, the Supporters page does not seem to be a reliable source, as the people in the prefered demographic are highly unlikely to join due to the requirement of pledging money to the organisation. Rather, collecting ages while selling tickets seems to be a more accurate measure, as people will give out such details if it is posed as a way to determine ticket prices.</p>
