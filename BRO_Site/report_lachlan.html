    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The website has been designed with two goals in mind; firstly, it aimed to increase the number of attendees to the Barrier Reef Orchestra performances, and secondly aimed to lower the average age of attendees.
<br>To this end, the website was built with the intent to be an advertising platform through which awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra could be spread, increasing general interest. 
<br>The new website was also to be more interactive and engaging. The objective was to make people spend more time on the website.
<br>Finally, more than letting people know what the Barrier Reef Orchestra was doing and promoting their concerts, the website was aimed at becoming a source of information about classical music as well.
