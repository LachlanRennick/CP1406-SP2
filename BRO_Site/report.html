    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The website has been designed with two goals in mind; firstly, it aims to increase the number of attendees to the Barrier Reef Orchestra performances, and secondly aims to lower the average age of attendees.
        <br>To this end, the website was built with the intent to be an advertising platform through which awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra could be spread, increasing general interest.
        <br>The new website is also to be more interactive and engaging than the previous one, in order to attract younger audiences.
        <br>The objective is to make people spend time on the website. More than only finding what they were initially looking for, the website has to make them stay and feel like discovering the Orchestra.
