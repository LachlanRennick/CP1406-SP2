    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The website has been designed with two goals in mind; firstly, it aims to increase the number of attendees to the Barrier Reef Orchestra performances, and secondly aims to lower the average age of attendees.
        <br>To this end, the website was built with the intent to be an advertising platform through which awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra could be spread, increasing general interest.
        <br>The new website is also to be more interactive and engaging than the previous one, in order to attract younger audiences.
        <br>The objective is to make people spend time on the website. More than only finding what they were initially looking for, the website has to make them stay and feel like discovering the Orchestra.
    </p>
    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lachlan:</strong> Wrote the group agreement, created the HTML and CSS pages, wrote the plan, submitted on the server</li>
        <li><strong>Mathilde: </strong> In charge of the design, information architecture and content. Stated the mission, target audience, success evaluation; listed the content that had to feature in each page; worked on Adobe Illustrator and InDesign to create the designs; imagined the flowchart; selected the pictures for the website; created the PDF files; wrote all the content (text and images) in Kye's templates; changed the fonts; worked on the Javascript for the Facebook Feed and the calendar.</li>
        <li><strong>Kye: </strong> Created the templates for every page (HTML and CSS), according to Mathilde's design; worked on the Javascript for the two photo galleries; created the forms on the Support Us page; fixed everything, made it look good according to Mathilde's ideas (CSS mostly).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testing Details</h2>
    <p>On the Support Us Page: the form works but the validation doesn't.
        <br>We wanted to add events to the calendar so that people can see when is the next show, but we could not make the Javascript work properly.
        <br>On the calendar, we could not make the arrows next to the month visible.

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong>Sharing of workload, socialisation, meeting new people, easier to deal with complex problems, sharing competencies.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong>Lack of overall control, the 'third wheel'</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong>Reliance on communication, makes us work on our adaptability</p>
