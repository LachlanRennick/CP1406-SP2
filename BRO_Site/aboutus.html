        <p>Fast becoming one of North Queensland’s <strong>cultural jewels</strong> the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches its <strong>15th year</strong> of performing <strong>orchestral music</strong> throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting of the finest musicians drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions.</p>
    <p>An outstanding performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed by Peter Sculthorpe’s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are testament to <strong>the orchestra’s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration</strong>.</p>
    <p>In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its <strong>continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland</strong>. </p>
